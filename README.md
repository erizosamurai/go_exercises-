# Go Learning Projects

This repository contains all the small projects and exercises I built to learn Go effectively. Most of the projects are from [Gophercises](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises) by Jon Calhoun. I highly recommend checking it out if you are interested in learning Go through project-based learning. These exercises help you practice solving real problems and encourage you to think in Go.
